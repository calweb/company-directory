# Company Directory

The purpose of this application is to capture data of employees and students throughout TIY.

## Root/Sign in Page

You will be required to have a sign in. Your sign in will be coordinated with your TIY login. For example, nick@theironyard.com will be able to sign in to this site. Somerandomdude@theironyard.com will not unless given permission.

As this is open sourced, I imagine a use case where investors may want to check students progress and what-not. So, there will be a "Request Permission" button on the sign in. When clicked it will open a dialog where the person will enter their names and email. Once submitted, an email will be sent to the administration user.

## User Roles

The administrator user will be able to create user rolls. On this creation screen the user will select modules of the application that the user has access to and the level of access they have.

##### Levels of access:

- Read only: If choosing this, you will also be prompted for which attributes the role can read from
- Read/Write: This user will be able to read/write all of the attributes
- Delete/Inactivate: This user can do anything

For example, students will have Names, Address, City, State, Zip. The user will create a role that can "Read Only" on Name. Any users that are assigned that role will not be able to access anything other than the students names.

## Navigation Bar/Side bar/General styling?

- Not sure. We should discuss
